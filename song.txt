Maroon 5 

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
Tu bien sabes que yo te ando buscando
Aunque en el tiempo paso aun yo te sigo amando
Tengo un mapa de papel
Y camino sobre el
Donde estes llegare
No tienes chance para escaparte
Te sigo buscando por cielo y tierra
Razon de ti nadie me da
Pa' toda mi piel ya no hay mapa
Que me conducira
Esto parece ficcion
Hasta en la television
Como entender la cancion que estoy haciendo
Para encontrarte
Y yo fui quien te acompañó en la oscuridad
Quien nunca falló. Ehh
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest night
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest night
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
